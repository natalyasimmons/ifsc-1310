  <h2>Progressive Enhancement Writing Assignment</h2>
  <p>To me, progressive enhancement is making sure that all users are provided the essential content and functionality of a website. It also ensures that users with the most modern browsers, meaning the required code, get the best experience possible.I think progressive enhancement is important in modern web development because technology is constantly evolving and it's important to make websites accessible to many different types of devices. As the article stated, there's many layers to gathering your content and considering how functional it is. On older devices, it may not function as properly compared to newer devices. The same goes for older browsers as well. The most important thing to do is work with your content first then expand to css and js.</p>
    <p>According to this article, <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/progressive-enhancement-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it/"> Progressive enhancement, what it is and how to use it</a>, it's important to have a strong foundation to fall back on when as you continue to make your project more complex. And with today's society, almost everyone has a mobile device. So knowing how your website functions and looks on all type of devices is something that progressive enhancement is a part of. Some functions may not work on a phone or javascript may be disabled for some in places such as work or school. Progressive enhancement allows users to start with the complex and work on more layers as they go.</p>

  <h2>Dragon Project Reflection</h2>
  <p>Working on this project was a bit challenging for me. It took a lot of work and patience when trying to build my project. I struggle trying to focus and keep my attention on my project when writing code. I do get side tracked a bit during my work, so trying to really focus on my project took time. I did get a better understanding of HTML. I knew a bit of HTML but never really understood what it all.meant. I feel more comfortable when it comes to writing my own HTML from scratch. I got a good sense of how to structure my HTML correctly and make it easy to read. I would take more time to study CSS. Although I have somewhat of an understanding of CSS, I still struggle with knowing how to set it up and remembering all of the selectors and their uses. Knowing how to design a website is work and knowing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is very important. When taking this class, I did overthink at times and think that I had to know everything right off the bat. But I know that it takes years of practice to be able to remember all the coding and even then, technology is constantly changing and evolving so there's always more to learn.</p>
    <p>The feedback I received was to edit my FAQs page. My friends that reviewed my page thought the FAQs looked messy and not as easy to read for a question and answer section. So I used the link that you provided to make the details coding. I added in the questions and surrounded them using my style css. Now when you click the question, the answers come down, which makes the overall design of the website more organized and clean. Other than that, the feedback I received was mainly positive and they liked the design and structure of the website.</p>
