<h2> Hogwarts Legacy</h2>
<p><em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> is a 2023 action role-playing game developed by Avalanche Software and published by Warner Bros Games under its Portkey Games label. The game is set in the Wizarding World universe, taking place in the late 1800s, a century before the events of the Harry Potter novels. The player controls a student at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who learns to wield different magical abilities and objects, aided by other students and professors, and is involved in uncovering an ancient secret of the wizarding world.</p>

<h3>Hogwarts Legacy Controvery</h3>
<p>Before release, the game attracted controversy due to the views on transgender people held by the Harry Potter creator, <strong>J. K. Rowling</strong>, and allegations that the game included antisemitic tropes, leading to calls for a boycott. The early access of the game led to record-breaking concurrent viewers on streaming platform Twitch, making Hogwarts Legacy the most-watched single-player game of all time. The game received generally favourable reviews from critics, with praise for the combat, world design, and characters, and criticism for its side missions and technical problems.</p>
