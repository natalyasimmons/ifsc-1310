<h2> Hogwarts Legacy</h2>
<p><em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> is a 2023 action role-playing game developed by Avalanche Software and published by Warner Bros Games under its Portkey Games label. The game is set in the Wizarding World universe, taking place in the late 1800s, a century before the events of the Harry Potter novels. The player controls a student at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who learns to wield different magical abilities and objects, aided by other students and professors, and is involved in uncovering an ancient secret of the wizarding world.</p>

<h3>Hogwarts Legacy Controvery</h3>
<p>Before release, the game attracted controversy due to the views on transgender people held by the Harry Potter creator, <strong>J. K.

<p>Gamespot positively noted,</p><blockquote>"The design and exploration elements of Hogwarts Castle were amazing and the combat and spells worked with a great sense of power"</blockquote>

<p>Travis Northup, writing for IGN, disagreed that the game involved antisemitic tropes, and stated on Twitter</p><q>The story does not depict a cabal of bank-controlling goblins trying to take over the world. It's about one particular goblin rebelling against the Wizarding World's insistence on keeping magic out of the hands of their kind</q>
